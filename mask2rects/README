Overview
--------
This C++ program finds rectangle covers for a given set
of arbitrary point regions given in a PNG image mask.
The connected components are calculated, then a process
of trial and error attempts to find the cover containing
the least number of rectangles. The resulting bounding
boxes are written to a text file, and can be optionally
rendered to a PNG image.


Dependencies
------------
GD Graphics Library - www.libgd.org


Building
--------
Just run make:
$ make


Input
-----
A PNG image where each pixel is determined to be part of
a region based on its RGB value. If any component of the
color is greater than 125 (0 being the least and 255 the
maximum) it is assumed to be foreground, otherwise the
pixel is treated as background and ignored in all further
calculations.


Output
------
A text file where each line is of the form

x0,y0,x1,y1

giving the bounding box for that rectangle. The points
are inclusive, and x0 <= x1 and y0 <= y1.

The optional rendered output image will draw foreground
in white, bounding rectangles in light green, and cover
rectangles in other arbitrary contrasting colors.
